Introduction
============

The main goal of the fuc package (pronounced "eff-you-see") is to wrap some of the most **f**\ requently **u**\ sed **c**\ ommands in the field of bioinformatics into one place.

The package is written in Python, and supports both command line interface (CLI) and application programming interface (API) whose documentations are available at the `Read the Docs <https://sbslee-fuc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Currently, fuc can be used to analyze, summarize, visualize, and manipulate the following file formats:

- Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM)
- Binary Alignment/Map (BAM)
- CRAM
- Variant Call Format (VCF)
- Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)
- Browser Extensible Data (BED)
- FASTQ
- FASTA
- General Feature Format (GFF)
- Gene Transfer Format (GTF)
- delimiter-separated values format (e.g. comma-separated values or CSV format)

Additionally, fuc can be used to parse output data from the following programs:

- Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
- SnpEff
- bcl2fastq and bcl2fastq2

Your contributions (e.g. feature ideas, pull requests) are most welcome.

Installation
============

The following packages are required to run fuc:

.. parsed-literal::

   biopython
   lxml
   matplotlib
   matplotlib-venn
   numpy
   pandas
   pyranges
   pysam
   scipy
   seaborn
   statsmodels

There are various ways you can install fuc. The recommended way is via conda (`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`__):

.. code-block:: text

   $ conda install -c bioconda fuc

Above will automatically download and install all the dependencies as well. Alternatively, you can use pip (`PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`__) to install fuc and all of its dependencies:

.. code-block:: text

   $ pip install fuc

Finally, you can clone the GitHub repository and then install fuc locally:

.. code-block:: text

   $ git clone https://github.com/sbslee/fuc
   $ cd fuc
   $ pip install .

The nice thing about this approach is that you will have access to development versions that are not available in Anaconda or PyPI. For example, you can access a development branch with the ``git checkout`` command. When you do this, please make sure your environment already has all the dependencies installed.

Below is the list of submodules available in the fuc API:

- **common** : The common submodule is used by other fuc submodules such as pyvcf and pybed. It also provides many day-to-day actions used in the field of bioinformatics.
- **pybam** : The pybam submodule is designed for working with sequence alignment files (SAM/BAM/CRAM). It essentially wraps the `pysam <https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ package to allow fast computation and easy manipulation.
- **pybed** : The pybed submodule is designed for working with BED files. It implements ``pybed.BedFrame`` which stores BED data as ``pandas.DataFrame`` via the `pyranges <https://github.com/biocore-ntnu/pyranges>`_ package to allow fast computation and easy manipulation. The submodule strictly adheres to the standard `BED specification <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html>`_.
- **pycov** : The pycov submodule is designed for working with depth of coverage data from sequence alingment files (SAM/BAM/CRAM). It implements ``pycov.CovFrame`` which stores read depth data as ``pandas.DataFrame`` via the `pysam <https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ package to allow fast computation and easy manipulation.
- **pyfq** : The pyfq submodule is designed for working with FASTQ files. It implements ``pyfq.FqFrame`` which stores FASTQ data as ``pandas.DataFrame`` to allow fast computation and easy manipulation.
- **pygff** : The pygff submodule is designed for working with GFF/GTF files. It implements ``pygff.GffFrame`` which stores GFF/GTF data as ``pandas.DataFrame`` to allow fast computation and easy manipulation. The submodule strictly adheres to the standard `GFF specification <https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md>`_.
- **pymaf** : The pymaf submodule is designed for working with MAF files. It implements ``pymaf.MafFrame`` which stores MAF data as ``pandas.DataFrame`` to allow fast computation and easy manipulation. The ``pymaf.MafFrame`` class also contains many useful plotting methods such as ``MafFrame.plot_oncoplot`` and ``MafFrame.plot_summary``. The submodule strictly adheres to the standard `MAF specification <https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/>`_.
- **pysnpeff** : The pysnpeff submodule is designed for parsing VCF annotation data from the `SnpEff <https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/>`_ program. It should be used with ``pyvcf.VcfFrame``.
- **pyvcf** : The pyvcf submodule is designed for working with VCF files. It implements ``pyvcf.VcfFrame`` which stores VCF data as ``pandas.DataFrame`` to allow fast computation and easy manipulation. The ``pyvcf.VcfFrame`` class also contains many useful plotting methods such as ``VcfFrame.plot_comparison`` and ``VcfFrame.plot_tmb``. The submodule strictly adheres to the standard `VCF specification <https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf>`_.
- **pyvep** : The pyvep submodule is designed for parsing VCF annotation data from the `Ensembl VEP <https://asia.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html>`_ program. It should be used with ``pyvcf.VcfFrame``.
